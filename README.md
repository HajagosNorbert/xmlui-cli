# xmlui cli

This project started as a demo, some aspects of it, such as setup stayed that way.

It is assumed that xmlui-mcp is in the ../xmlui-mcp dir
and that xmlui-test-server is in ../xmlui-test-server, and that it follows git@github.com:HajagosNorbert/xmlui-test-server.git repo's "demo" branch. This will obviously change, but for now, this repo is a placeholder of what was demoed.
